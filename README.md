# Crop Production data analysis
## React + TypeScript + Vite

- This project provides analysis of various crop production data in `India` from 1950 to 2020.
- Data is visualized in `table` format.
- we can see 2 tables
  Table 1 : Maximum and Minimum crop production for each year between 1950 - 2020.
  Table 2 : Average Yield and Average Cultivation area for each crop for all the years.

## Development Tools used :

- `Vite` - It is a build tool for fast development, works seamlessly with `React`, `Vue`, `Svelte`.
- React Refresh - for faster live re-loading during development.

## Libraries Used :

- `React.js` - for building UI(user interface).
- `TypeScript` - It is superset of JavaScript, adding static types to it.
- `Mantine`  - It is a react component library, provides huge range on components, hooks to build complex UIs.
- `@mantine/core` - for core UI components.
- `@mantine/hooks` - for custom hooks.
- `@mantine/styles` - for styling components.
